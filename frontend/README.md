# Editorial Interface - Frontend

Welcome to the Editorial Interface project! This repository contains frontend applications for managing editorial content.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React.js and Material-UI. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and managing editorial content.

### Technologies Used
- React.js
- Material-UI
- Fetch (for API requests)

### Build Tools
- **Webpack**: A powerful module bundler for JavaScript applications, used to compile and bundle the React application.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deepak-panchal27/editorial-interface.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To build the project in development mode, run:
```bash
npm run build:dev
```

To start the project in development mode, run:
```bash
npm run serve:dev

#This will build the project for development using webpack and serve the project for development.
```

### Accessing the Application
Once the frontend is running, you can access the application at [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
